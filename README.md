This is simple eComerence app made as a task in React. In app, user can store products in shopping cart. Before checkout, user can get quantity  discount for some products and he can also use promocodes for discount. First two  promocodes can be used together, while third one can be used independently. User can finish order by entering some of his data and after order is finished it can be seen in orders card. I was using Firebase database for storing products and orders data. For shopping cart functionality, I used Redux.
